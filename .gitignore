# Fairseq (if it's a submodule or just a local copy, you might want to adjust)
# If fairseq is a submodule, you generally don't ignore the directory itself,
# but rather its internal build files. If it's just copied, then you'd ignore
# its build artifacts.
# For now, assuming fairseq/ is where you have your fairseq project.
